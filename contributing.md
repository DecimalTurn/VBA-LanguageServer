## Debugging Language Server

* Use the Client + Server launch configuration.

## Debugging Antlr Grammar

Requires the  ANTLR4 grammar syntax support extension installed. Each time you open the workspace, you'll need to open a grammar file to activate the extension.

Note the grammar file for this project can be found at /server/src/antlr/vba.g4

### Show Parse Tree

* Open the VBA file you want to debug.
* Run `Debug ANTLR4 grammar` from launch configurations.

### Debug Rule

* Open the grammar file.
* Right click a rule and choose an option from the context menu.
  * Show Railroad Diagram for Rule
  * Show ATN Graph for Rule

The grammar call graph is interesting, but not particularly useful. Generating "valid" input generates garbage.
